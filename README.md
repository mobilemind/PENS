[PENS Drafts](https://github.com/ADL-AICC/PENS/releases)

> Notes to Editors: This repo includes configuration files so that the
> `markdown` files can be more easily checked using either of the utilities
> `mdl` <https://github.com/mivok/markdownlint> or `markdownlint`
> <https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint>. Please format your Markdown
> such that it passes these checks.
>
> Examples:
>
> `mdl PENS_v2.0.0_Draft.md`
>
> or
>
> `markdownlint.json PENS_v2.0.0_Draft.md`
>
> The `mdl` utility will implicitly use the `.mdlrc` file included in this
> repo, whereas `markdownlint` will require that the configuration file is
> specified. The `markdownlint.json` file is included in this repo and is
> functionally equivalent to `.mdlrc` as provided.
